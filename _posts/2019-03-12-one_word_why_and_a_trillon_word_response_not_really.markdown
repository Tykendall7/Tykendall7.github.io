*To bridge the gap between public health and applications…*
 
I have a Master of Public Health degree with a focus in Epidemiology. In case you didn’t know what an epidemiologist is, I can attempt to explain it in one sentence, "we solve the world's issues by analyzing data to predict trends and try to nip it in the bulb."  Epidemiologists, like myself, depend on relational data systems to hold vast amounts of data to determine the cause and effect of a disease. Instead of manually counting and calculating each variable, we learned to code in various languages such as SAS, R, SQL, and Python. 

As epidemiologist and database administrator, I work aside health care facilities, laboratories, Information Technology, and developers to make sure that the bi-directional flow of data into relational systems is working accurately. Sounds pretty cool right? Well in my work experience, I have realized that there is a significant limitation; the people creating the systems do not fully understand the needs of the end user. On the other hand, the end user doesn’t know how to adequately communicate their needs and ask those important technical questions. As the liaison between those in development and the end users, I can help bridge the gap. 

By enrolling in this program, I decided to throw on my super-hero cape and mask to help save the world.
